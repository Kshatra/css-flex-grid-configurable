        Recently i had to implement a grid that should behave like this:

        Obviously, most framework grids will not allow this. And we had to support IE11, so no CSS Grid, sorry.
        We ended up discarding the "grid" concept and creating some custom styling specifically for that component.
        But after that i decided that there should be an universal solution for such things. Maybe it's even already implemented. But, here's SCSS that i came up with:




        <h1>6-column grid</h1>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-padding-x grid-small-6">
                <div class="cell small-1">Always 1/6</div>
                <div class="cell small-5">
                    <p>Cell occupies 5/6 of container and holds inner grid that is has 4 columns on small and 7 on large breakpoints</p>
                    <div class="grid-container">
                        <div class="grid-padding-x grid-small-4 grid-large-7">
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">1/4 on small, 1/7 on large</div>
                            <div class="cell small-1 large-1">etc...</div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
